            <h4>Tools</h4>
            <p>There are three FabLab located in SP. Went in-depth with the tools available in the FabLab (e.g. 3D printer,
                Laser Cutters, Routers & etc.) that can be use to make the product for this module.<br> After going through
                this topic, i have a rough idea of the product i intend to produce (charging booth, crane machine and puzzle 
                toy).<br> The second half of this topic is about the software. The most important tools are the text editor and Fusion
                360. I also pick a few essential (refer to <a href=assignment.html>Assigment</a> page) to help ease my journey
                for this module.
