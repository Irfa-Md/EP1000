              <p>Went through the module map and assement brief for digital fabrication.<br> Took the FabLab Safety Programme.
                  Learn the importance of safety equipment and do and don't while in the lab. Also understanding the safety

            <h4>Tools</h4>
            <p>There are three FabLab located in SP. Went in-depth with the tools available in the FabLab (e.g. 3D printer,
                Laser Cutters, Routers & etc.) that can be use to make the product for this module.<br> After going through
                this topic, i have a rough idea of the product i intend to produce (charging booth, crane machine and puzzle 
                toy).<br> The second half of this topic is about the software. The most important tools are the text editor and Fusion
                360. I also pick a few essential (refer to <a href=assignment.html><i>Assigment</i></a> page) to help ease my journey
                for this module.

            <h4>HTML & CSS</h4>
            <p>Created a folder to keep all the files in one place, create a copy for safekeeping. Created the most crucial file called
                <i>index.html</i> to kickstart the whole project. Added <i>head,title,body and a paragraph</i> for my first practice. Then 
                i created the <i>about.html</i>, a page to describe myself. I took a selfie and pasted it in a table, that is filled with my 
                personal particulars. To link both my file i created a <i>hyperlink</i> between both my two file. Also got introduce to w3school
                site that will help me expand my knowledge on HTML & CSS. To expand my webpage i created a documention page
                (<i>project.html</i>) and a assignment page (<i>assignment.html</i>).
            </p>
            <p>Created a CSS file (<i>mystyles.css</i>) to make my webpage look nicer. Learn that CSS help break down the webpage
            into different sections (header,nav,div and footer). My first practice was to make my header look nicer, i change the font size and color
            and center the text with a padding of 30px. To familiarise myself with CSS coding, i created a new folder with a new <i>index.html</i>
            and css file. I followed the Jack Wright video to understand how to design a basic layout of a webpage. After that practice, i decided
            to implement a horizontal navigation bar. I followed the code from w3school, the only modificaton i made was making the corner rounder
            and bigger font.
