                <h3>Project Design</h3>
                <p>The idea of the RGB clock is by a user named 'Mark Daniel Belarmino' on the ProjectHub. The parts for his 
                    project consists of 140 Neopixels, Arduino ATmega2560 & RTC DS1307. In his project, he 3D printer his body work 
                    and have 4 LEDs per digit. In contrast, i will be using a 28 Neopixels, Arduino UNO/NANO & RTC DS3231. I also followed
                    his code and made a few changes by adding a PIR input and 7-segment binanry input. As for the wiring of the NeoPixels,
                    i was recommended by my lecturer to watch 'DIY Arduino LED clock | Arduino Projects | 7 Segment Display | LED digital Clock from Cardboard'
                    by 'Art, Craft and Knowledge'. The video shows me how to connect each pixel to display the time.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>The project was a success, even though the coding took a long time. There were no defect for laser cuts and the printer model.
                    There is a minor problem with the PIR sensor, there seem to be a delay when trying to activate it. In terms of upgradability,
                    i could add rotary switches so that the clock can be manually adjust.
